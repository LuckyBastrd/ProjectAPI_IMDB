# IMDB API Movie Data Project

This IMDB API Integration Project is a collaborative endeavor undertaken by Rafi and Niko. This project serves as an exploratory venture, showcasing our adeptness in working with APIs by harnessing the power of the IMDB API from RapidAPI. Our primary objective is to leverage this API to retrieve comprehensive movie data and seamlessly integrate it into a user-friendly website.

## Introduction

By utilizing the IMDB API available on RapidAPI, our project demonstrates a proficient use of APIs. This API provides detailed information about movies, including movie type, titles, release dates, durations and episodes. Our implementation of the API underscores our determination to grasp the nuances of working with external data sources.

This project utilizes the ASP.NET Framework, developed within the environment of Visual Studio 2019, along with the Bootstrap Framework for crafting the user interface. For the backend, we employ C# and leverage the HTTPClient from RapidAPI to establish communication with the IMDB API, thereby extracting comprehensive movie details..
